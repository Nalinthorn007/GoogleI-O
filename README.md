Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up the UV package manager and get your project running.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install Git
Download and install Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads

### 2. Verify Git Installation
After successful installation, verify that Git is working by running:
```bash
git --version
```

### 3. Clone the Repository
Navigate to your desired folder and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nalinthorn007/GoogleI-O.git
```
The files will be downloaded automatically to your current directory.

## UV Installation

### 4. Check UV Installation Status
First, check if UV is already installed:
```bash
uv --version
```
**Run this command in PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux)**

### 5. Install UV (if not already installed)
If UV is not installed, follow the installation guide at: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/

### 6. Verify UV Installation
After installation, verify that UV is working correctly:
```bash
uv --version
```
**Run this command in PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux)**

### 7. Sync Dependencies
Once UV is successfully installed, synchronize all project dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```
This will create a `.venv` virtual environment and install all required libraries.
